# Overview
Text generation is a process where an AI system produces written content, imitating human language patterns and styles. The process involves generating coherent and meaningful text that resembles natural human communication.This project focuses on comparing the performance of various text generation models to help users choose the most suitable model for their specific needs.
## About
Topsis (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) is a multi-criteria decision-making method used to identify the best alternative from a set of options.
## Project Structure
- `Results.csv` : CSV file containing the results of the Evaluation.
- `Topsis.csv` : CSV file containing the outcomes of the TOPSIS Analysis.
- `Graphs` : Bar graphs comparing TOPSIS scores and individual metrics ("BLEU_Score", "ROUGE_Score", "Perplexity") are saved also as PNG files.
## Dependencies
- Torch : PyTorch library for deep learning.
- Transformers : Hugging Face Transformers library for pre-trained language models.
- nltk : Natural Language Toolkit for BLEU score calculation.
- Rouge-score: Library for ROUGE score calculation.
- Pandas : Data manipulation library.
